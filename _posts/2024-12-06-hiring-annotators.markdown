# Hiring Annotators

Are you proficient in *Malayalam*, *Odiya*, *Santali*, or *Bodo*? Be a part of a pioneering initiative to advance Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology for Indian languages by contributing as a language annotator. This project provides a unique opportunity to preserve India’s linguistic diversity while enhancing the accuracy and accessibility of OCR systems for complex Indian scripts.

As an annotator, you will work with LIPIKAR, an advanced annotation software designed for precisely annotating text data, enabling high-quality dataset creation for OCR technologies. Your role will involve annotating written texts and capturing real-time scene text images, such as road signs and advertisements, to build comprehensive datasets for your language.

This initiative is crucial for fostering linguistic heritage and driving technological advancements in language processing. Join us in creating a lasting impact on Indian language computing—limited slots are available, so apply now to contribute to this academic and technological endeavour.
