[Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/) is an open-source text analysis platform that analyses and visualises large text corpora for digital humanities projects. It allows users with no coding knowledge to produce a granular analysis of texts through multiple sophisticated techniques. The Voice of Voyant project seeks to create interfaces for Voyant Tools in multiple Indian languages. 

Here is an opportunity to volunteer to donate your language knowledge towards deepening multilingual DH tools to Indian languages by devoting a few hours of work this summer. At present the project is looking to create Voyant skins in Assamese, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Mizo, Odia, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu.

# What Youâ€™ll Do:
* Translate terms using a simple spreadsheet
* Work remotely with a small team
* Complete the task in just 1-2 weeks
* Receive a certificate from IIT Delhi and Voyant.org

# Who Can Apply?
 If you're an undergrad or above, fluent in one of the listed languages, and know your way around Google Sheets, we want to hear from you!
