The Digital Humanities Research group at the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences works at the intersection between digital tools and humanities research in the Indian context. The focus of research is on the use of computational techniques for multiple Indian languages. In collaboration with the [Computer Vision Laboratory](https://vision-iitd.github.io/) at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Dehlhi we have reached a level of confidence in Optical Character Reading technology for multiple Indian languages. We are currently experimenting on adapting computational tools to work on Indian language texts and contexts.

Additionally, the Digital Humanities efforts at IIT Delhi are committed to undertake teaching and other pedagogic steps to introduce students of the humanities to computational methods of analysis.
